# Movie Genre Prediction from Plot Summaries

## ðŸ“Œ Problem
This project builds a classifier that predicts a movieâ€™s genre based on its plot summary. It helps organize content and build smarter recommender systems.

## ðŸ§  Model
We use TF-IDF to transform plot text into features and train a Decision Tree classifier to predict genres.

## ðŸ“Š Results
- Accuracy: ~60%
- Precision/Recall: varies by genre
- Common confusions: Comedy â†” Drama

## ðŸ“ˆ Improvements
- Try Naive Bayes or SVM
- Expand to multi-label classification
- Use word embeddings instead of TF-IDF
